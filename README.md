## General info
```
Usage:
bash cgol
```

* You may notice that the first two lines of the file are preceeded with "#". Immediately proceeding these are two options which you may set to your liking.

  * option-1: Size of the grid. i.e. "6" for 6x6, or "16" for 16x16
  
     * options for both length and width may be added at some point in the future. For now, its just NxN

  * option-2: The data for the grid.
  
     * You may be so inclined as to randomize the digits or just pound your keyboard with as many one's and zero's as possible. There is no limit even though the grid will only recognize the input to the degree of NxN

  * Also no characters besides "1" or "0". But since I haven't schemed this algebraically you can edit the code so as to add functionality for additional characters i.e. "P" and "3"

# Sorry!
Sorry for the convoluted mess that is my README. I still haven't gotten around to styling these properly. :(
